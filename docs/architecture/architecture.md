# Repository Architecture

## Purpose

security-engineering-lab is organized as a modular DevSecOps and security-learning platform. The repository separates runnable labs, reusable tools, operational scripts, and long-form documentation so each part can be reviewed or improved independently.

The project is intentionally local-first: labs are designed for Vagrant rather than public cloud infrastructure, with KVM/QEMU and libvirt as the default provider and VirtualBox supported as a cross-platform alternative (see the [README's Supported providers section](../../README.md#supported-providers)). This keeps security testing contained and makes the environments repeatable on a workstation.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Reproducible labs:** Lab environments should be deployable from documented Vagrantfiles and scripts.
2. **Clear safety boundaries:** Offensive content belongs in isolated lab contexts with explicit authorization guidance.
3. **Separation of concerns:** Labs, standalone security tools, sysadmin utilities, and guides live in distinct directories.
4. **Documentation with examples:** Setup, architecture, workflows, and troubleshooting are documented near the code they support.
5. **Portfolio readability:** A reviewer should be able to identify the purpose, skills demonstrated, and runnable entry points quickly.

## Main Components

### `labs/`

Runnable environments for infrastructure and security practice.

| Lab | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| `labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/` | Linux administration, Vagrant with a single unified Vagrantfile supporting both KVM/libvirt and VirtualBox, Kubernetes, DevOps workflow documentation |
| `labs/security/active-directory/base/` | Active Directory attack-chain practice in a controlled lab |
| `labs/security/active-directory/vlan-segmented/` | VLAN segmentation, subnet design, and network isolation testing |

Expected lab contents:

- `Vagrantfile` for VM definition and provisioning
- `README.md` for setup and usage
- `scripts/` for repeatable operations
- `docs/` for architecture, workflow, credentials, or troubleshooting notes
- `configs/` for lab-specific configuration when needed

### `tools/security/`

Standalone security utilities and experiments.

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `audit/` | LLM security scanner, validator, and Cisco switch audit tooling |
| `exploitation/` | Educational exploit, SQL injection, and hashcat assistant scripts |
| `network/` | Firewall scan wrapper, Scapy port scanner, tcpdump wrapper, and Ettercap menu |
| `reconnaissance/` | Amass, nmap, and port-scanning helpers |
| `wireless/` | Wireless lab tooling, including evil-twin experimentation |

### `tools/sysadmin/`

Linux administration and day-2 operations scripts.

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `monitoring/` | System, security, and log monitoring utilities |
| `system-hardening/` | Audit, hardening, antivirus, rootkit, user, and network checks |
| `utilities/` | General Linux utilities for backups, firewall, memory, DNS, Git, and media tasks |

### `docs/`

Project-level documentation for architecture, safe use, setup, and workflows. Longer tutorials and reference guides live under `docs/guides/`.

## Provisioning Philosophy

Each lab is provisioned by a single Vagrantfile with inline shell/PowerShell
provisioners rather than a separate Ansible (or other config-management)
control layer. This is a deliberate choice for this project, not an
oversight:

- **Single-host home lab, not a fleet.** There is one control point
  (`vagrant up`) and no persistent inventory of machines to manage over
  time, so a dedicated control-node/inventory/role structure would add
  process without solving a problem this repo actually has.
- **Fewer moving parts to install and keep working.** A contributor only
  needs Vagrant, a provider (KVM/libvirt or VirtualBox), and their host
  package manager. Adding
  Ansible as a hard dependency would mean another tool, another version to
  pin, and another thing that can drift from what's documented.
- **Provisioning logic stays next to what it provisions.** Everything a VM
  needs is defined in one file per lab (`labs/*/*/Vagrantfile`), which
  keeps the "what does this VM actually run at boot" answer in one place
  instead of split across a Vagrantfile, an inventory file, and a set of
  roles.

The trade-off is real and intentional: the Vagrantfiles are long
(1,000–2,700 lines) and provisioning steps are procedural bash rather than
declarative, idempotent roles. That's an acceptable cost here because each
VM is rebuilt from scratch (`vagrant destroy && vagrant up`) far more often
than it's incrementally reconfigured — the properties Ansible is best at
(idempotent, incremental convergence on long-lived hosts) aren't the
properties this repo needs.

This is why `docs/guides/infrastructure/ansible-automation.md` exists as a
**stand-alone practice guide** (run Ansible manually against the already-up
lab nodes) rather than as documentation of how the labs themselves are
built. Replacing the Vagrant shell provisioners with real Ansible roles is
tracked as a mid-term idea in [`../project/roadmap.md`](../project/roadmap.md)
if the labs grow enough VMs, or enough repeated reconfiguration, to justify
the added layer.

## Safety Model

The repository contains intentionally vulnerable configurations, weak lab credentials, and offensive security workflows. These are acceptable only because they are scoped to isolated labs.

Required controls:

- Run labs only on networks you own or control.
- Keep lab networks isolated from production and employer systems.
- Do not bridge intentionally vulnerable systems onto public networks.
- Treat credentials in lab documentation as throwaway training material.
- Review [`../security-scope.md`](../security-scope.md) before running offensive scenarios.

---

## Quality Standards

New labs should include:

- Clear prerequisites and resource requirements
- One primary setup path
- A validation command such as `vagrant validate`, `vagrant status`, or a lab-specific test script
- Expected outputs or success criteria
- Cleanup instructions
- Security scope and isolation notes

New scripts should include:

- A short usage description
- Safe defaults
- Input validation where practical
- Clear error messages
- Minimal required privileges

## Roadmap

| Phase | Goal |
|-------|------|
| Consolidation | Keep repository structure and documentation aligned with the actual tree |
| Validation | Add CI checks for shell, Python, Markdown, and Vagrant configuration |
| Lab UX | Add a common lab launcher or management wrapper |
| Evidence | Add screenshots, diagrams, and expected-output captures for each featured lab |
| Standardization | Add lab metadata files for resources, dependencies, safety level, and validation commands |
