- Token impersonation.
- ZeroLogon (`CVE-2020-1472`) and PetitPotam (`CVE-2021-36942`).
- NoPac (`CVE-2021-42287`) and Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (`RBCD`).
- PrintNightmare (`CVE-2021-1675` / `CVE-2021-34527`).

### Cloud
- AWS IAM privilege escalation through LocalStack simulation.
- S3 bucket enumeration and data exfiltration.
- EC2 metadata service exploitation.

### AI / LLM Security
- Prompt injection and jailbreaking.

## Suggested Exploration Path

1. [`labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/README.md`](../../labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/README.md) — start with the base infrastructure.
2. [`labs/security/ad-pentest/README.md`](../../labs/security/ad-pentest/README.md) — move into the core offensive security environment.
3. [`tools/security/audit/`](../../tools/security/audit/) — explore the LLM and detection tooling layer.
4. [`docs/architecture/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture/architecture.md) — review the full system design.
