# Dependencies

This page is the single reference for what the repository needs to run,
develop against, and validate — host OS, Python, Kubernetes, external
security tools, and Python package dependencies. It complements the
step-by-step instructions in [`docs/setup/`](setup/) rather than
replacing them.

---

## Supported host operating systems

The labs are provisioned with Vagrant + KVM/libvirt and are developed
and tested against:

| OS family | Notes |
|---|---|
| Debian / Ubuntu (recent LTS) | Primary, most-tested target. Setup guides give `apt` commands. |
| Fedora / RHEL-family | Supported via KVM/libvirt; setup guides give `dnf`/`yum` equivalents where they differ. |

macOS and Windows hosts are not directly supported for running the
Vagrant/libvirt labs (nested KVM virtualization is Linux-specific).
Windows users can run the labs inside WSL2 with a Linux distribution
listed above, or via a Linux VM with nested virtualization enabled.

## Python

- **Required: Python 3.12+** for all first-party tooling under
  `tools/`, `tests/`, and `scripts/`. `tools/lib/` requires 3.12+ and
  uses modern union-type syntax (`X | Y`) and builtin generics
  (`list[int]`), so earlier interpreters are not supported.
- Individual lab automation scripts under `labs/security/*/scripts/`
  may pin their own dependency set — see each lab's `requirements.txt`.

## Kubernetes

- The `devops-linux-lab` (`labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/`)
  runs a **K3s** cluster (currently pinned to `v1.31.4+k3s1` — see that
  lab's [`README.md`](../labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/README.md)
  for the authoritative, up-to-date version table), with Harbor
  (container registry + Trivy scanning) and Argo CD (GitOps) deployed
  on top. A `k3d` (K3s-in-Docker) variant is also provided for a
  lighter-weight local setup.
- There are no standalone Kubernetes manifest files checked into this
  repository outside that lab's provisioning scripts.
- **Documentation drift (fixed in this pass):** `labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/docs/k8s-setup.md`
  previously described an older `kubeadm` + Calico setup
  (`k8s-cp`/`k8s-w1`/`k8s-w2` hostnames) that no longer matched the
  current K3s-based architecture described in that lab's `README.md`.
  It has been rewritten to document the actual K3s setup and is now
  linked from [`docs/README.md`](README.md)'s index.

## Required external security tools

These are invoked by scripts under `tools/security/` and the lab
automation under `labs/security/`. Install via your OS package manager
unless noted otherwise.

| Tool | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nmap` | `tools/security/reconnaissance/nmap-menu.py` | |
| `amass` | `tools/security/reconnaissance/amass-scan.sh` | |
| `enum4linux` | `tools/security/reconnaissance/enum4linux-menu.py` | |
| `tcpdump` | `tools/security/network/tcpdump-wrapper.py` | requires elevated privileges to capture |
| `ettercap` | `tools/security/network/ettercap-menu.py` | lab/VLAN use only |
| `iptables`/`nft` (firewall tooling) | `tools/security/network/firewall-scan.sh` | |
| `vagrant` + `vagrant-libvirt` plugin | all `labs/` environments | see [`docs/setup/`](setup/) |
| `shellcheck` | CI, `make lint`, pre-commit | |
| `bats-core` | `tests/bash/`, `make test` | |

Run [`scripts/check-prerequisites.sh`](../scripts/check-prerequisites.sh)
to validate host-level prerequisites (KVM, libvirt, Vagrant, plugins,
resources) before standing up a lab, and
[`scripts/validate_lab.py`](../scripts/validate_lab.py) to validate the
repository itself (structure, docs, Vagrantfile syntax).

## Python package dependencies

### Runtime (used by individual tools/labs, install per-tool)

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| [`labs/security/requirements.txt`](../labs/security/requirements.txt) | AD Pentest lab automation (`rich`, `pyyaml`, `aiofiles`, `requests`, `aiohttp`, `colorama`, `urllib3`) |
| `scapy` | `tools/security/network/scapy-port-scan.py` (install separately: `pip install scapy`) |
| `requests` | `tools/security/exploitation/exploit.py` and other HTTP-based tools |

`tools/lib/` (the shared utilities package) is standard-library only
by design — it adds no new runtime dependencies.

### Development

Pinned in [`requirements-dev.txt`](../requirements-dev.txt):

```
pylint
pytest>=9.1.1
pytest-cov
flake8
bandit
pre-commit
detect-secrets
ruff
black
mypy
```

`ruff`, `black`, and `mypy` are opt-in/informational only (`make format`,
`make typecheck`) and are configured in [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml);
they are not part of the blocking `make lint` target.

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt --break-system-packages
```

(`--break-system-packages` is only needed on distros with PEP 668
externally-managed environments; use a virtualenv instead if you
prefer.)

## Supply chain notes

- Development tooling is version-pinned with a lower bound
  (`pytest>=9.1.1`) rather than exact pins, to stay compatible with CI
  runner updates while still guaranteeing a minimum feature set.
- OS packages (`nmap`, `vagrant`, `shellcheck`, etc.) are intentionally
  **not** pinned to exact versions in documentation — they track
  whatever the host distribution provides, since this is a lab
  environment, not a production deployment target.
- `detect-secrets` runs in CI and pre-commit to catch accidental
  credential commits; see `.secrets.baseline` for the current
  allow-list.
- `bandit` findings in `tools/security/` are informational only —
  see [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) for why offensive-security
  scripts intentionally trip some bandit rules.
