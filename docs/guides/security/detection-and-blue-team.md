# Detection and Blue Team Guide

A defensive counterpart to the lab attack guides. For every technique in the AD Pentest Lab and VLAN Lab, this guide shows what evidence it leaves behind, which event IDs to monitor, and how to write detection rules against it.

All Event IDs reference Windows Security, System, and Sysmon logs. Log sources assume Sysmon is installed and Windows Event Forwarding is configured.

## 1. Lab Monitoring Setup

### Enable Key Windows Audit Policies

Run on the Domain Controller and all Windows hosts via Group Policy or directly:

```powershell
# Enable advanced audit policies
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Logon" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Account Logon" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Kerberos Authentication Service" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Kerberos Service Ticket Operations" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Directory Service Access" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Directory Service Changes" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Process Creation" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Privilege Use" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Account Management" /success:enable /failure:enable
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Security System Extension" /success:enable /failure:enable

# Enable PowerShell script block logging
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScriptBlockLogging" `
  -Name "EnableScriptBlockLogging" -Value 1

# Enable PowerShell module logging
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ModuleLogging" `
  -Name "EnableModuleLogging" -Value 1
```

### Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)

Collect logs from all Windows hosts to a central collector:

```powershell
# On each source host — enable WinRM
winrm quickconfig -q

# On the collector host — create a subscription
wecutil cs /c:subscription.xml

# Verify events are flowing
Get-WinEvent -LogName "ForwardedEvents" -MaxEvents 10
```

### Event Log Sizes

Increase log sizes to retain evidence longer:

```powershell
# Security log — set to 1 GB
wevtutil sl Security /ms:1073741824

# Sysmon log — set to 512 MB
wevtutil sl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational /ms:536870912
```

---

## 2. Sysmon Deployment

Sysmon dramatically improves visibility into process creation, network connections, file writes, and registry changes.

### Install Sysmon

```powershell
# Download from Sysinternals
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Sysmon.zip" -OutFile "Sysmon.zip"
Expand-Archive Sysmon.zip

# Install with a hardened config (SwiftOnSecurity is widely used)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml" `
  -OutFile "sysmonconfig.xml"

.\Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml

# Verify running
Get-Service Sysmon64
```

### Key Sysmon Event IDs

| Event ID | Description | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Process Create | Captures every process with full command line and parent |
| 3 | Network Connection | Outbound and inbound TCP/UDP connections |
| 5 | Process Terminated | Tracks short-lived processes |
| 7 | Image Loaded | DLL loads — catches DLL injection and hijacking |
| 8 | CreateRemoteThread | Cross-process thread injection |
| 10 | ProcessAccess | LSASS access for credential dumping |
| 11 | FileCreate | File written to disk |
| 12 | Registry Object Added/Deleted | Registry persistence |
| 13 | Registry Value Set | Registry value modification |
| 15 | FileCreateStreamHash | Alternate data stream creation |
| 17 | Pipe Created | Named pipe creation |
| 18 | Pipe Connected | Named pipe connection (getsystem) |
| 22 | DNS Query | DNS resolution — detects C2 beaconing |
| 25 | Process Tampering | Process hollowing detection |

---

## 3. Reconnaissance Detection

### Nmap Port Scanning

**What it leaves:**
- Rapid connection attempts to many ports from one source IP
- TCP SYN packets without completing handshake (SYN scan)
- Failed connection attempts across many ports

**Event IDs:** Windows Firewall logs (5156, 5157), Sysmon Event 3

**Detection rule:**

```
Alert if: single source IP makes >50 connection attempts in 60 seconds
  to destination ports spanning more than 20 unique values
```

**Lab action:** On the DC or WIN10, open Event Viewer → Windows Logs → Security → filter on Event ID 5156/5157 after running an nmap scan from Kali.

### BloodHound / LDAP Enumeration

**What it leaves:**
- High-volume LDAP queries in a short timeframe
- Queries for all users, groups, computers, and ACLs simultaneously
- Source is an authenticated domain user, not a service account

**Event IDs:** 4662 (Directory Service Access), 1644 (LDAP diagnostic — requires enablement)

**Enable LDAP diagnostic logging:**

```powershell
# On DC — enable LDAP interface events
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Diagnostics" `
  -Name "15 Field Engineering" -Value 5
```

**Detection:**

```
Alert if: single account issues >500 LDAP queries in 5 minutes
  AND queries include objectClass=user AND objectClass=group AND objectClass=computer
```

### DNS Zone Transfer

**What it leaves:** A single DNS query of type AXFR to port 53 TCP

**Event IDs:** DNS Server debug log (requires enablement)

```powershell
# Enable DNS debug logging on DC
Set-DnsServerDiagnostics -All $true
```

**Detection:** Alert on any AXFR query from a non-DC source IP.

---

## 4. Credential Attack Detection

### LLMNR / NBT-NS Poisoning (Responder)

**What it leaves:**
- Unusual NTLM authentication to an IP that is not a domain controller or known server
- LLMNR and NBT-NS broadcast traffic on the subnet
- NTLMv2 authentication events from hosts that were not trying to reach any known resource

**Event IDs:** 4624 (Logon), 4625 (Failed Logon)

**Detection:**

```
Alert if: NTLM authentication (Event 4624, Logon Type 3)
  where Workstation_Name does not match any known server hostname
  AND Authentication_Package = NTLM
```

**Mitigation:** Disable LLMNR via Group Policy:
```
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Network →
DNS Client → Turn off multicast name resolution → Enabled
```

Disable NBT-NS:
```powershell
# Disable on all adapters
$adapters = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -Filter "IPEnabled=true"
foreach ($adapter in $adapters) { $adapter.SetTcpipNetbios(2) }
```

### AS-REP Roasting

**What it leaves:** Kerberos AS-REQ without pre-authentication (PA-DATA missing)

**Event IDs:** 4768 (Kerberos TGT Request)

**Detection:**

```
Alert if: Event 4768
  where Pre_Authentication_Type = 0 (no pre-auth)
  AND Account_Name does not match known service accounts
```

**Lab exercise:**

```powershell
# On DC — find accounts with pre-auth disabled
Get-ADUser -Filter {DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $true} -Properties DoesNotRequirePreAuth
```

### Kerberoasting

**What it leaves:** TGS request for a user account SPN with RC4 encryption

**Event IDs:** 4769 (Kerberos Service Ticket Request)

**Detection:**

```
Alert if: Event 4769
  where Ticket_Encryption_Type = 0x17 (RC4-HMAC)
  AND Account_Name does not end with $  (not a machine account)
  AND Service_Name does not equal krbtgt
```

**Lab exercise — watch for Kerberoasting:**

```powershell
# On DC — monitor for RC4 TGS requests in real time
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath `
  "*[System[EventID=4769] and EventData[Data[@Name='TicketEncryptionType']='0x17']]" `
  -MaxEvents 20
```

### Password Spraying

**What it leaves:**
- Multiple failed logon attempts (4625) across many different accounts from one source
- Low failure count per account (avoids lockout) but high total count from same IP

**Event IDs:** 4625 (Failed Logon), 4771 (Kerberos Pre-Authentication Failed)

**Detection:**

```
Alert if: single source IP generates >10 Event 4625 failures
  across >5 unique Account_Name values
  in a 5-minute window
```

### NTLM Relay Attack

**What it leaves:**
- Successful authentication from one host to another using credentials that originated from a third host
- NTLM authentication followed immediately by SMB access on a different target
- Inbound SMB connection from an unexpected source

**Event IDs:** 4624 (Logon Type 3), 4648 (Explicit Credentials Logon)

**Detection:**

```
Alert if: Event 4624 Logon_Type=3
  where source IP is not the account's normal workstation
  AND authentication follows within 5 seconds of an outbound connection from source
```

**Mitigation:** Enable SMB signing on all hosts:

```powershell
# Via Group Policy (preferred) or directly:
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters" `
  -Name "RequireSecuritySignature" -Value 1
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters" `
  -Name "RequireSecuritySignature" -Value 1
```

### GPP Credential Extraction

**What it leaves:**
- SMB access to the SYSVOL share
- Reads of Groups.xml or other Preferences XML files

**Event IDs:** 5140 (Network Share Access), 4663 (File Access)

**Detection:**

```
Alert if: Event 5140
  where Share_Name = SYSVOL
  AND Source_Address is not a domain controller IP
  followed by: Event 4663 for access to any *.xml file under Policies\
```

**Mitigation:** Microsoft released MS14-025 which removes the ability to set passwords via GPP. Ensure all DCs are patched and audit SYSVOL for any remaining Groups.xml files containing `cpassword`:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "\\$env:USERDNSDOMAIN\SYSVOL" -Recurse -Include "*.xml" |
  Select-String -Pattern "cpassword" |
  Select-Object Path, Line
```

  where source IP is not in list of known admin workstations
  AND User-Agent is not a known browser
```

**Mitigation:** Enable EPA (Extended Protection for Authentication) on IIS Certificate Enrollment web services.

### ESC9 — No Security Extension

**Detection:**
```
Alert if: Event 4887
  where Certificate does not contain szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT
  AND Certificate has Client Authentication or Smart Card Logon EKU
  AND certificate was issued to a non-privileged account
```

  AND Properties contains {1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2}
    (DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All)
```

**Lab exercise — trigger DCSync and observe the event:**

```powershell
# On DC — watch for DCSync in real time
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath `
  "*[System[EventID=4662] and EventData[Data[@Name='Properties'] and (Data='1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2' or Data='1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2')]]" `

# Enable LocalStack request logging
export LS_LOG=debug
localstack start

# Watch for bucket enumeration
tail -f /var/log/localstack.log | grep -E "ListBuckets|GetObject|ListObjects"

# Alert on any access to internal-docs bucket from unexpected source
tail -f /var/log/localstack.log | grep "internal-docs" | grep -v "10.0.0.1"
```

**Detection patterns:**

```
Alert if: LocalStack log shows ListBuckets or ListUsers

# On llm01 — follow all lab-app log output
journalctl -u llm-owasp-lab -f

# Alert on suspicious prompt content or blocked actions
journalctl -u llm-owasp-lab -f | grep -iE \
  "override_detected.:true|blocked_command|blocked_path_traversal|rate_limited|daily_quota_exceeded"
```

**Detection patterns:**

```
Alert if: llm-owasp-lab journal shows:
  "override_detected":true          (LLM01 prompt-injection attempt against /llm01/chat)
  "blocked_command"                 (LLM06 attempted a non-allowlisted "tool" command)
  "blocked_path_traversal"          (LLM06/LLM02 attempted to escape the data/sandbox path)
  "cross_tenant_leak":true          (LLM08 rag-query returned another tenant's documents)
  "rate_limited" or "daily_quota_exceeded" repeated from the same client_id (LLM10 abuse)
```

## 12. Falco Rules for the DevOps Lab

These rules detect suspicious activity in your k3s cluster (DevOps lab). Deploy on the `devops-1` VM.

### Container Escape Attempts

```yaml
# /etc/falco/rules.d/lab-rules.yaml

- rule: Container running as root attempts shell
  desc: A container running as root spawned a shell
  condition: >
    spawned_process and
    container and
    proc.name in (shell_binaries) and
    user.uid = 0
  output: >
    Root shell spawned in container
    (user=%user.name container=%container.name image=%container.image.repository
    cmd=%proc.cmdline)
  priority: WARNING

- rule: Sensitive file access in container
  desc: Sensitive file read inside a container
  condition: >
    open_read and
    container and
    fd.name in (/etc/shadow, /etc/passwd, /root/.ssh/authorized_keys, /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)
  output: >
    Sensitive file read in container
    (file=%fd.name container=%container.name image=%container.image.repository
    user=%user.name)
  priority: HIGH
```

### Kubernetes API Abuse

```yaml
- rule: Suspicious kubectl exec
  desc: kubectl exec into a production-like namespace
  condition: >
    ka.verb = "create" and
    ka.target.subresource = "exec" and
    not ka.user.name in (known-admin-users)
  output: >
    kubectl exec by unexpected user
    (user=%ka.user.name pod=%ka.target.name ns=%ka.target.namespace)
  priority: WARNING

- rule: ClusterRole with wildcard permissions created
  desc: A ClusterRole with * permissions was created
  condition: >
    ka.verb in (create, update) and
    ka.target.resource = "clusterroles" and
    ka.request.object contains '"*"'
  output: >
    Overly permissive ClusterRole created
    (user=%ka.user.name role=%ka.target.name)
  priority: HIGH

- rule: ServiceAccount token mounted in suspicious pod
  desc: Pod created with automounted service account token in unexpected namespace
  condition: >
    ka.verb = "create" and
    ka.target.resource = "pods" and
    ka.target.namespace != "kube-system" and
    ka.request.object contains '"automountServiceAccountToken":true'
  output: >
    Pod with service account token in non-system namespace
    (user=%ka.user.name pod=%ka.target.name ns=%ka.target.namespace)
  priority: WARNING
```

### Harbor Registry Abuse

```yaml
- rule: Unexpected image push to Harbor
  desc: Image pushed to Harbor from unexpected source
  condition: >
    ka.verb = "create" and
    ka.target.resource = "artifacts" and
    not ka.user.name in (known-ci-users)
  output: >
    Unexpected image push to Harbor
    (user=%ka.user.name project=%ka.target.namespace image=%ka.target.name)
  priority: WARNING
```

### Reload Falco after adding rules

```bash
vagrant ssh devops-1
sudo systemctl reload falco

# Verify rules loaded
sudo falco --list | grep "lab-rules"

# Watch Falco alerts in real time
sudo journalctl -fu falco
```
