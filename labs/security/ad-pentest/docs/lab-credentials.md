# Active Directory Pentest Lab — Complete Credential Matrix

## Intentional Training Credentials — Read First

This file contains deliberately exposed and weak credentials created exclusively for an isolated, intentionally vulnerable Active Directory lab.

These accounts and passwords are:

- Not real.
- Not reused anywhere.
- Not representative of secure practices.

They exist solely to support penetration-testing training and hands-on practice of common Active Directory attack paths.

Do not replicate these patterns in production environments.
