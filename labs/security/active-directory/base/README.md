Enterprise-grade Active Directory penetration testing lab built with Vagrant, supporting both KVM/libvirt and VirtualBox from a single unified Vagrantfile. Simulates modern corporate attack surfaces with up to 11 VMs and 60+ realistic attack paths, selectable via [Lab Profiles](#lab-profiles) — the default `ad` profile brings up 6 VMs (~19GB RAM); `LAB_PROFILE=full` brings up all 11 (~29.5GB RAM).

> **VirtualBox users:** this lab's `Vagrantfile` supports VirtualBox as well as KVM/libvirt (for hosts without KVM/libvirt, including macOS and Windows) — select it with `--provider=virtualbox`. See [VirtualBox Provider](#virtualbox-provider).

## Lab Architecture

### Network Topology

![AD Pentest Lab network topology diagram](diagrams/ad-pentest-topology.png)

Two isolated networks:

| Network | Subnet | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| NAT | 192.168.122.0/24 | Internet access and package updates |
| Corporate | 172.28.128.0/24 | Internal attack surface (isolated) |

### Critical Network Rules
- DNS resolves to DC01 at 172.28.128.21.
- Static IP allocation only, no DHCP.
- Internal network is isolated from external internet.
- Domain: `lab.local`.

## Lab Profiles

As of this version, `vagrant up` (no arguments) no longer builds all 11 VMs. `kali` and `dc01` are always created; every other VM is created only if it belongs to the active `LAB_PROFILE`. This is controlled by the `LAB_PROFILE` environment variable and is enforced directly in the `Vagrantfile` — it is not just documentation.

```bash
LAB_PROFILE=minimal vagrant up   # kali, dc01, win10
LAB_PROFILE=ad vagrant up        # default — kali, dc01, db01, ca01-esc, win10, linux01
LAB_PROFILE=web vagrant up       # ad profile + juice-shop
LAB_PROFILE=cloud vagrant up     # ad profile + cloud-pentest
LAB_PROFILE=llm vagrant up llm01 # just the OWASP LLM Top 10 lab (+ always-on kali, dc01)
LAB_PROFILE=full vagrant up      # everything — all 11 VMs
vagrant up                       # LAB_PROFILE unset -> defaults to "ad"
```

| Profile | VMs created | vCPU | RAM | Intended use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `minimal` | kali, dc01, win10 | 6 | ~10 GB | Fastest bring-up. Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting, local-admin-to-domain-admin, basic BloodHound enumeration. |
| `ad` **(default)** | kali, dc01, db01, ca01-esc, win10, linux01 | 11 | ~19 GB | The standard day-to-day AD lab — adds AD CS (ESC1/3/4/6/7/8), a second lateral-movement target (db01), and one non-domain-joined Linux box (linux01). |
| `web` | `ad` profile + juice-shop | 13 | ~21 GB | Everything in `ad`, plus an OWASP Juice Shop target for web-application exercises. juice-shop itself has no AD integration. |
| `cloud` | `ad` profile + cloud-pentest | 13 | ~21 GB | Everything in `ad`, plus a LocalStack-based AWS attack-surface simulation. cloud-pentest itself has no AD or hybrid-identity integration — it's a standalone IAM/S3/Lambda misconfiguration sandbox. |
| `llm` | kali, dc01, llm01 | 8 | ~12 GB | Just the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications training lab (see [`llm-lab/README.md`](llm-lab/README.md)) alongside the always-on `kali`/`dc01`. No AD attack surface beyond the base domain. |
| `full` | all 11 VMs | 22 | ~29.5 GB | Adds print01 (PrintNightmare), llm01 (OWASP LLM Top-10), metasploitable2 (legacy CVEs), juice-shop, and cloud-pentest on top of `ad`. |

An invalid `LAB_PROFILE` value (e.g. `LAB_PROFILE=bogus vagrant up`) fails fast with an error listing the valid profile names, instead of silently falling back to something unexpected.

**Bringing up a VM outside the active profile:** because excluded VMs are never defined (not just powered off), `vagrant up print01` fails with "machine not found" unless `print01` is in the active profile. Select a profile that includes it instead:

```bash
LAB_PROFILE=full vagrant up print01
LAB_PROFILE=full vagrant up llm01
LAB_PROFILE=full vagrant up metasploitable2
LAB_PROFILE=web vagrant up juice-shop
LAB_PROFILE=cloud vagrant up cloud-pentest
```

**Per-VM resource overrides** (`DB01_MEMORY`, `WIN10_CPUS`, etc.) and **per-VM IP overrides** (`DB01_IP`, `WIN10_IP`, etc.) are unaffected by `LAB_PROFILE` and continue to work exactly as before.

---

## Attack Automation

The lab includes a Python-based automation framework that runs attack modules in a controlled, phased sequence.

**File:** `scripts/lab_attack_automation.py`

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r labs/security/requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```bash
cd labs/security/active-directory/base

# List all registered attack modules
python3 scripts/lab_attack_automation.py --list-attacks

# Run all phases (safe mode — skips destructive attacks)
python3 scripts/lab_attack_automation.py --config lab_config.json --report

# Run with confirmation token (recommended)
export LAB_ATTACK_TOKEN=mytoken
python3 scripts/lab_attack_automation.py --lab-confirm mytoken --report

# Run only specific phases
python3 scripts/lab_attack_automation.py --phases recon credential_attacks

# Run a single attack by name
python3 scripts/lab_attack_automation.py --target Kerberoasting

# Enable destructive attacks
python3 scripts/lab_attack_automation.py --no-safe-mode --report
```

### Config file

Create `lab_config.json` with your lab credentials before running. Set credentials via environment variables to avoid storing them in the file:

```bash
export LAB_CRED_LABADMIN="LabAdmin123!"
export LAB_CRED_JOHN_DOE="Password123!"
export LAB_CRED_SVC_SQL="SqlSvcPass123!"
# ... and so on for each account
```

### Attack phases

| Phase | Attacks |
|-------|---------|
| `recon` | AS-REP Roasting, BloodHound Collection |
| `credential_attacks` | Kerberoasting, GPP Extraction, Password Spraying, SMB Relay |
| `exploitation` | ZeroLogon, PetitPotam, AD CS ESC1/3/4/6/7/8/9, Shadow Credentials, NoPac, RBCD, PrintNightmare, SQL xp_cmdshell |
| `privilege_escalation` | Lateral Movement, DCSync, LLMNR/NBNS Poisoning, gMSA abuse, ADIDNS wildcard abuse |
| `cloud_llm` | Cloud Misconfiguration Enumeration, IAM Abuse, Terraform State Discovery, LLM Vulnerability Tests |

### Reports

After each run, the framework saves two output files:

- `lab_report_<timestamp>.txt` — human-readable report with pass/fail for each attack.
- `lab_report_<timestamp>.json` — structured JSON for further processing.

All sensitive data such as hashes, tickets, and keys is automatically redacted before it reaches the log or report files.

---

## Lab Manager

Use the included interactive manager instead of typing raw Vagrant commands.

**Why:** the Vagrantfile only defines the VMs in your active `LAB_PROFILE` — raw `vagrant up print01` under the default `ad` profile fails with `The machine 'print01' was not found configured for this Vagrant environment`, because `print01` genuinely doesn't exist under that profile, not because of a typo. `scripts/vagrant_manager.py` knows about `LAB_PROFILE` and handles this for you instead of leaving you to decode that error yourself.

```bash
python3 scripts/vagrant_manager.py
```

It discovers VM names directly from the `Vagrantfile` and is `LAB_PROFILE`-aware (see [Lab Profiles](#lab-profiles)): it reads the `Vagrantfile`'s `LAB_PROFILES` hash and your `LAB_PROFILE` environment variable, so `--list`, the interactive "a. all" option, and a bare `up`/`halt`/`reload`/`provision`/`destroy` with no VM names all default to only the VMs that actually exist under your active profile — not all 11. VMs excluded by the current profile are shown grayed out with a hint (e.g. `print01 (needs LAB_PROFILE=full)`).

**Picking an excluded VM in the interactive menu:** you're not locked out of it. The menu asks whether to run just that one action under the profile that includes it — e.g. picking `print01` under `LAB_PROFILE=ad` asks *"'print01' requires LAB_PROFILE=full... Run this one action with LAB_PROFILE=full?"*. Answering yes runs only that command under `full`; the rest of your session (and your shell's `LAB_PROFILE`) is untouched. Answering no cancels cleanly instead of erroring out against Vagrant. Option `8` ("List all lab VMs") shows every VM, its status, and which profile(s) include it, for browsing before you commit to anything.

**Non-interactive / scripted use** (`up`, `halt`, etc. passed as CLI args) does not prompt — it's meant for automation, so an excluded VM name is rejected immediately with an error naming the profile it belongs to, rather than blocking on a question no one is there to answer:

```bash
python3 scripts/vagrant_manager.py --list        # print discovered VM names and exit
python3 scripts/vagrant_manager.py up win10 db01  # bring up specific VMs
python3 scripts/vagrant_manager.py status         # show vagrant status and exit

LAB_PROFILE=full python3 scripts/vagrant_manager.py --list   # see/target all 11 VMs
LAB_PROFILE=full python3 scripts/vagrant_manager.py up print01
```

Requires the `rich` package: `pip install rich`.

There is also a lower-level libvirt admin tool for pool, network, and domain management:

```bash
./scripts/libvirt-manager.sh
```

Use `libvirt-manager.sh` when you need to inspect or clean up libvirt resources directly — storage pools, virtual networks, domain snapshots, and disk images — outside of Vagrant's control.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**System Requirements:**
- Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux.
- KVM/libvirt installed and enabled.
- 32GB+ RAM, 16GB minimum but performance suffers.
- 200GB+ available storage.
- CPU with virtualization support, Intel VT-x or AMD-V.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients \
  bridge-utils virt-manager vagrant libvirt-dev
```

### Step 2: Configure User Permissions

```bash
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
newgrp libvirt
```

### Step 3: Install Vagrant Plugins

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
vagrant plugin install vagrant-winrm
```

### Step 4: Clone and Deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solo2121/security-engineering-lab.git
cd security-engineering-lab/labs/security/active-directory/base
```

### Step 4.5: Verify Host Readiness

```bash
# Run from this lab's directory — also checks the vagrant-winrm plugin this lab needs
../../../../scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --lab1
```

### Step 5: Start Domain Controller First

```bash
vagrant up dc01
```

Verify DC is ready:

```bash
vagrant ssh dc01 -c "type C:\\DC-FINAL.txt"
```

### Step 6: Deploy the Lab

```bash
vagrant up
```

With no `LAB_PROFILE` set, this brings up the default `ad` profile (kali, dc01, db01, ca01-esc, win10, linux01 — 6 VMs, ~19GB RAM). See [Lab Profiles](#lab-profiles) for the full list of profiles and how to select a different one.

**Estimated time:** 20–40 minutes for the default `ad` profile; 50–90 minutes for `LAB_PROFILE=full`, varying by hardware.

### Step 7: Selective Lab Deployment

Choose a smaller or larger profile with the `LAB_PROFILE` environment variable:

```bash
LAB_PROFILE=minimal vagrant up   # kali, dc01, win10 only (~10GB RAM)
LAB_PROFILE=full vagrant up      # all 11 VMs (~29.5GB RAM)
```

See [Lab Profiles](#lab-profiles) for the complete profile table and instructions on starting an individual VM that isn't in your active profile.

### Step 8: Tearing Down the Lab

To stop and remove all VMs for this lab and reclaim host resources:

```bash
cd labs/security/active-directory/base
vagrant destroy -f
```

---

## VirtualBox Provider

This lab's [`Vagrantfile`](Vagrantfile) supports both KVM/libvirt and
VirtualBox from the same file — select the provider with `--provider` (or
`VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`). It defines the same VM names, hostnames,
static IPs, `LAB_PROFILE` values, provisioning logic, and Vagrant Cloud
boxes for both providers; only the `config.vm.provider` block (memory/CPU
settings, disk/NIC driver, VirtualBox `vb.customize` calls vs. libvirt
`lv`/`libvirt` settings) and the private-network configuration
(`virtualbox__intnet` vs. libvirt's `vagrant0` bridge) differ. Use
VirtualBox on hosts that don't have KVM/libvirt (macOS, Windows, or Linux
hosts where libvirt isn't available or desired).

**Which parts are shared vs. provider-specific:**
- Shared: VM naming, static IP allocation, `LAB_PROFILE` selection logic, base boxes, provisioning shell/PowerShell scripts, credentials, and attack scenarios — identical regardless of provider, since it's the same `Vagrantfile`.
- Provider-specific: the `configure_libvirt`/`configure_virtualbox` functions (provider resource/driver settings), `configure_network` (private network implementation), and the Windows adapter-detection PowerShell (adapter names and NAT IP ranges differ between libvirt's and VirtualBox's default networking).
- `config.rb` (if you use one) is shared too now — one file in this directory, loaded regardless of which provider you select. See [Configuration](#configuration) below.

### Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 7.0+ (Extension Pack recommended for USB/RDP passthrough, not required for this lab).
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) >= 2.2. The VirtualBox provider is built into Vagrant — no extra provider plugin is required (unlike `vagrant-libvirt`, which this Vagrantfile only requires when you select `--provider=libvirt`).
- `vagrant-reload` and `vagrant-winrm` plugins (same as libvirt):
  ```bash
  vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
  vagrant plugin install vagrant-winrm
  ```
- Hardware virtualization (Intel VT-x / AMD-V) enabled in the host BIOS/UEFI. On **Apple Silicon (ARM/M1–M4) Macs, VirtualBox is not supported** — VirtualBox only runs on Intel/AMD (x86_64) hosts. Use UTM, VMware Fusion, or a cloud x86 host instead, or run this same Vagrantfile with `--provider=libvirt` on a Linux x86_64 host.
- Same RAM/disk sizing as libvirt (see [Version 1.13 Highlights](#version-113-highlights)).

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solo2121/security-engineering-lab.git
cd security-engineering-lab/labs/security/active-directory/base
vagrant validate --provider=virtualbox
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
vagrant status
```

Other lifecycle commands, run from the same directory:

```bash
vagrant provision   # re-run provisioning without recreating VMs
vagrant reload       # restart VMs and re-apply network/provider settings
vagrant halt         # stop VMs, keep disks
vagrant destroy -f   # remove all VMs for this lab (does not touch other environments)
```

As with libvirt, `LAB_PROFILE` controls which VMs are created (default `ad`, 6 VMs):

```bash
LAB_PROFILE=minimal vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
LAB_PROFILE=full vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
```

You can also avoid passing `--provider` every time:

```bash
export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=virtualbox
vagrant up
```

### Configuration

All settings are controlled with the same environment variables regardless of provider (`DOMAIN_NAME`, `DC_IP`, `KALI_MEMORY`, `DC01_CPUS`, etc. — see the constants near the top of [`Vagrantfile`](Vagrantfile)), plus one VirtualBox-only variable:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LAB_GUI` | `false` | Set to `true` to open a VirtualBox GUI console window per VM instead of running headless. No effect under libvirt. |
| `<VM>_MEMORY`, `<VM>_CPUS` | per-VM defaults | Override memory (MB) / CPU count for a given VM, e.g. `DC01_MEMORY=8192`. |
| `<VM>_IP` | per-VM defaults | Override a VM's static IP (must stay inside `LAB_SUBNET`). |
| `LAB_PROFILE` | `ad` | Selects which VMs are created — see [Lab Profiles](#lab-profiles). |

An optional `config.rb` in this directory is loaded automatically if present, for host-specific overrides you don't want to export as environment variables — shared between both providers since there's now one Vagrantfile.

Both providers pull the same Vagrant Cloud boxes (`kalilinux/rolling`, `generic/ubuntu2204`, `peru/windows-10-enterprise-x64-eval`, `peru/windows-server-2022-standard-x64-eval`, etc.) — these are pulled automatically by `vagrant up` and require no manual download.

### Known limitations

- VirtualBox does not support nested KVM the way `vagrant-libvirt` does; if a scenario in this lab relies on nested virtualization, expect it to behave differently or be unavailable under VirtualBox.
- Not supported on Apple Silicon / ARM hosts (see Requirements above).
- Network isolation uses a VirtualBox internal network (`virtualbox__intnet`) rather than libvirt's isolated `vagrant0` bridge; behavior is equivalent for this lab but the underlying VirtualBox networking model differs.

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| `vagrant up` fails with "provider virtualbox not found" | VirtualBox not installed, or Vagrant can't find `VBoxManage` | Install VirtualBox and ensure `VBoxManage` is on your `PATH`. |
| `VBoxManage: error: ... rc=E_ACCESSDENIED` on Linux | Current user isn't in the `vboxusers` group, or kernel modules aren't loaded | `sudo usermod -aG vboxusers $USER`, log out/in, then `sudo modprobe vboxdrv`. |
| Host-only/internal network conflicts with another VirtualBox lab | Two labs both requesting `172.28.128.0/24` on `pentest_lab` | Run only one lab at a time, or set a different `LAB_SUBNET`/IP variables for one of them. |
| VM name already exists | A previous `vagrant destroy` didn't fully clean up | `VBoxManage list vms` to find stragglers, then `VBoxManage unregistervm <name> --delete`. |
| Guest Additions version mismatch warnings | Base box's Guest Additions predate your VirtualBox version | Install the `vagrant-vbguest` plugin (`vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`) to auto-update Guest Additions on boot. |
| Provisioning hangs on a Windows VM | WinRM not yet ready | Wait for the boot timeout (up to 2 hours for Windows Server boxes on first boot), or check `vagrant winrm list`. |
| Insufficient CPU/RAM errors from VirtualBox | Host doesn't have enough free resources for the selected `LAB_PROFILE` | Use `LAB_PROFILE=minimal`, or reduce individual `<VM>_MEMORY`/`<VM>_CPUS` values. |
| Apple Silicon Mac: "provider not found" or box download fails | VirtualBox does not run on ARM hosts | Not supported — see Requirements above. |

## Platform-Specific Guides

### LLM Platform (llm01)

Implements the current **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)** — see
[`llm-lab/README.md`](llm-lab/README.md) for full docs, the safety model, and the
category/endpoint/test table. Quick reference:

| Category | Endpoint prefix |
|---|---|
| LLM01: Prompt Injection | `/llm01` |
| LLM02: Sensitive Information Disclosure | `/llm02` |
| LLM03: Supply Chain | `/llm03` |
| LLM04: Data and Model Poisoning | `/llm04` |
| LLM05: Improper Output Handling | `/llm05` |
| LLM06: Excessive Agency | `/llm06` |
| LLM07: System Prompt Leakage | `/llm07` |
| LLM08: Vector and Embedding Weaknesses | `/llm08` |

## Lab Validation

See [`docs/dc01-deployment-validation.md`](docs/dc01-deployment-validation.md)
for a full phase-by-phase record of a successful `vagrant up dc01` run,
including static IP, AD promotion, security scenario configuration, and
network isolation checks.

### Check Services Status

```bash
# Test DC DNS
nslookup dc01.lab.local 172.28.128.21

# Test SQL Server
impacket-mssqlclient -k dc01.lab.local

# Test LLM Platform
curl http://172.28.128.60:8000/health

# Test Cloud VM
curl http://172.28.128.80:4566/_localstack/health
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `vagrant up <vm>` says "was not found configured for this Vagrant environment" | `<vm>` isn't in your active `LAB_PROFILE` (see [Lab Profiles](#lab-profiles)) | Either `LAB_PROFILE=full vagrant up <vm>`, or use `scripts/vagrant_manager.py` (see [Lab Manager](#lab-manager)), whose interactive menu offers to run that one VM under the right profile for you. |
| VM won't boot | Insufficient RAM | Increase RAM or reduce VMs. |
| DNS resolution fails | DC01 not ready | Wait 5-10 min, then reboot clients. |
| WinRM connection timeout | Firewall/network issue | `vagrant winrm list` to test. |
| LLM endpoints unreachable | Service not started | SSH and check `systemctl status llm`. |
| Cloud VM Docker errors | Docker daemon not running | SSH and run `sudo systemctl start docker`. |
| Vagrant hangs on SSH | Network misconfiguration | `vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up`. |
| High CPU/Memory usage | Too many VMs running | Use selective startup. |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check VM status
vagrant status

# SSH into a machine
vagrant ssh kali

# View VM logs
vagrant ssh dc01 -c "tail -f C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SYSTEM"

# Destroy and rebuild
vagrant destroy dc01
vagrant up dc01

# Increase verbosity
VAGRANT_LOG=debug vagrant up
```

---

## Performance Tips

### Before First Deployment

```bash
# Download base boxes locally
vagrant box add kalilinux/rolling
vagrant box add generic/ubuntu2204
vagrant box add peru/windows-server-2022-standard
```

### During Operation

1. Use selective startup to deploy only needed machines.
2. Disable swap to avoid slowdowns: `sudo swapoff -a`.
3. Monitor resources with `htop` and `iotop`.
4. Snapshot after DC setup for faster rollback: `virsh snapshot-create-as kali initial`.
5. Disable auto-updates and pause Windows Update during testing.

### Hardware Recommendations

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | Optimal |
|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| RAM | 16GB | 32GB | 64GB |
| CPU | 4 cores | 8 cores | 16+ cores |
| Storage | 200GB | 400GB | 1TB (SSD) |
| Network | Gigabit | 10GbE | 10GbE |

## Changelog

### v1.13 (unreleased)

**Changed:**
- `vagrant up` (no arguments) no longer creates all 11 VMs. `kali` and `dc01` are always created; every other VM (`db01`, `ca01-esc`, `win10`, `linux01`, `print01`, `llm01`, `metasploitable2`, `juice-shop`, `cloud-pentest`) is now created only if it belongs to the active `LAB_PROFILE`. Default profile is `ad` (kali, dc01, db01, ca01-esc, win10, linux01 — 6 VMs, ~19GB RAM), replacing the old always-on 11-VM (~29.5GB RAM) default. See [Lab Profiles](#lab-profiles).
- Removed the old "RESTRICTED STARTUP PROFILE (32GB HOSTS)" startup banner — it printed a suggested 6-VM subset (which itself omitted `db01` while including `llm01`/`cloud-pentest`) but never actually enforced it. `LAB_PROFILE` replaces it with an enforced mechanism.
- `juice-shop` now calls `write_lab_hosts`, matching `metasploitable2` and `cloud-pentest`. Previously it received no `/etc/hosts` lab entries.
- Removed `scripts/vagrant-manager.sh`. `scripts/vagrant_manager.py` is now the only supported lab manager; it already covered the same operations.
- `scripts/vagrant_manager.py` is now `LAB_PROFILE`-aware: `--list`, the interactive "a. all" option, and a bare `up`/`halt`/`reload`/`provision`/`destroy` with no VM names now default to only the VMs active under the current profile, instead of all 11 discovered names. VMs excluded by the active profile are shown with a hint instead of being silently targeted and reported as FAILED.

**Fixed:**
- Quick Start's "Selective Lab Deployment" step documented a `VAGRANT_VMS` environment variable that the `Vagrantfile` never read. Replaced with the real `LAB_PROFILE` mechanism.
- Quick Start Step 4's clone instructions referenced a nonexistent path (`labs/security/ad-pentest`); corrected to `labs/security/active-directory/base`.

**Breaking / migration notes:**
- If your workflow, scripts, or CI relies on bare `vagrant up` creating all 11 VMs, either run `LAB_PROFILE=full vagrant up`, or set `LAB_PROFILE=full` in your shell profile / CI environment to restore the old behavior exactly.
- `vagrant up <name>` for a VM outside the active profile now fails with "machine not found" instead of finding the machine — select a profile that includes it first, e.g. `LAB_PROFILE=full vagrant up print01`. This is a change from prior versions where all 11 machines were always defined and startable by name regardless of any profile.
- IP addresses, hostnames, VM names, `domain_join_windows`/`disable_internet_gateway`/`add_health_check` call signatures, and the attack-automation scripts are unchanged.
- `python3 scripts/vagrant_manager.py up` (or `halt`/`reload`/`provision`/`destroy`) with no VM names now targets only the active `LAB_PROFILE`'s VMs, not all 11 discovered names. Explicitly naming VMs (`vagrant_manager.py up print01`) is unaffected. If you have automation that relies on the old all-VMs default, set `LAB_PROFILE=full` in that environment.

### v1.12 (2026-07-31)

**Fixed:**
- Moved plugin validation inside the `Vagrant.configure` block to prevent false-positive failures.
- Added error handling for a missing or unloadable `config.rb`.
- Fixed `vagrant-hostmanager` alias syntax (aliases are now a proper array of strings).
- `configure_windows_comm` now accepts `boot_timeout` and `winrm_timeout` parameters; DC01 keeps extended 7200s timeouts for AD promotion while all other Windows VMs use the 3600s default.
- Added CPU/memory validation with warnings for out-of-range values in `VM_MEMORY` / `VM_CPUS`.
- Fixed duplicate `/etc/hosts` entries on `kali` and `linux01` (existing entries are now removed before fresh ones are appended).
- Added SSH key management (`vm.ssh.insert_key`) for `linux01`, `metasploitable2`, and `juice-shop`.
- `linux01`'s sshd hardening now edits existing `PermitRootLogin` / `PasswordAuthentication` directives instead of blindly appending duplicates.
- Juice Shop's Docker container now runs with `--restart=always` and the image is explicitly pulled before first run, so it survives VM reboots.
- Polkit CVE-2021-3560 provisioning on `linux01` no longer aborts if the service restart fails.

**Breaking / migration notes:**
- None for this release — all changes are backward compatible with existing `vagrant up` workflows. If you have a local `config.rb` with syntax errors, provisioning now continues with a warning instead of failing silently.

### v1.11 (2026-07-17)

**Removed:**
- Exchange Server (`exch01`) — mail server scenario retired.
- SharePoint (`sp01`) — web application scenario retired.
- Internal pentest node (`pnpt-internal`) — no longer part of the default topology.

**Changed:**
- VM inventory reduced from 14 to 11 machines to match the lab manager script.
- DNS records and `/etc/hosts` entries updated to drop the removed VMs.
- Restricted/minimal startup profile updated accordingly.
- All Active Directory attack logic (Kerberoasting, AD CS ESC paths, DCSync, etc.) preserved unchanged.

**Breaking / migration notes:**
- If you have existing automation, notes, or BloodHound data referencing `exch01`, `sp01`, or `pnpt-internal`, those hosts will no longer be present after `vagrant up`. Re-run recon against the current 11-VM inventory.
- Service accounts `svc_exchange` and `svc_sharepoint` no longer exist.

### v1.10 (2026-07-07)

**Added:**
- Centralized all VM constants (IPs, memory, etc.) in the Vagrantfile.
- Created a reusable domain-join function, removing 300+ lines of duplication.
- Added vagrant-hostmanager integration.
- Added health checks and debug mode.
- Added external config support (`config.rb`).
- Added provisioning checkpoints.
- Added `svc_webapp`, `svc_apppool`, and `svc_mssql2` as extra Kerberoastable targets.
- Added gMSA with Domain Users read permission (svc_sql_gmsa).
- Added ADIDNS wildcard record writable by Authenticated Users.
- Added modern attack vectors: ZeroLogon, PetitPotam, Shadow Credentials, NoPac, RBCD, Enhanced PrintNightmare, AD CS ESC9, LLMNR/NBNS Poisoning, and gMSA abuse.

**Changed:**
- Pinned all Ubuntu box versions.
- Reduced LLM01 RAM to 4GB (was 8GB).
- Improved error handling in all PowerShell scripts.
- Updated `svc_delegate` SPN from `HTTP/CA01.$domainName` to `HTTP/CA01-ESC.lab.local`.
- Added `CIFS/PRINT01.lab.local` SPN to `svc_delegate`.
- Enhanced lab validation and reporting.

**Fixed:**
- Static IP configuration now uses 5-method adapter detection.
- Windows Defender disabled via registry-only approach.
- AD promotion now uses explicit parameters.
- Domain DN hardcoded for correct PowerShell interpolation.
- DNS records hardcoded with IP addresses.
- Silenced a harmless `Set-NetConnectionProfile` error.
- Removed phantom DNS entry for non-existent `CA01` host (`.24`).
- Fixed SPN misconfiguration pointing to dead host instead of `CA01-ESC` (`.25`).
- Restored full compatibility with `vagrant validate` by removing unsupported syntax.

### v1.9 (2026-07-03)

**Added:**
- Modern Active Directory attack vectors.
- Expanded AD CS attack paths.
- Enhanced Linux, Windows, Cloud, and LLM attack scenarios.
- Additional attack coverage for Shadow Credentials, gMSA abuse, and ADIDNS wildcard behavior.
- New cloud attack vectors covering Lambda, Secrets Manager, EC2 user-data, metadata, and Terraform state exposure.
- Indirect prompt injection support in the LLM lab.

**Fixed:**
- CA DNS consistency.
