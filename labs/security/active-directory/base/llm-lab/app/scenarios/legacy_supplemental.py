"""
Legacy / Supplemental Scenarios
==================================
IMPORTANT: none of the categories in this module are part of the current
OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025). They correspond to categories
from an earlier OWASP LLM Top 10 revision (Model Theft, Insecure Plugin
Design) or to a technique that is now folded into current categories
(Indirect Prompt Injection is a sub-case of LLM01: Prompt Injection).

They are kept here, clearly labeled "legacy", purely as supplemental
teaching material for learners who want the historical context. See
GET /owasp/categories for the authoritative current list, and do not treat
anything below as an 11th, 12th, or 13th "current" OWASP category.

Test case: see tests/test_app.py::test_legacy_endpoints_labeled
