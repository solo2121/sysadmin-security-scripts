LLM03: Supply Chain
=====================
Vulnerability description:
    LLM applications depend on third-party models, datasets, and packages.
    Unpinned dependencies, unverified model artifacts, and missing
    provenance metadata let a compromised upstream component reach
    production undetected.

Educational objective:
    Show how to check a package/model manifest's pinning and provenance
    metadata, and what a failed check looks like, without ever downloading
    anything at runtime.

Safe vulnerable behavior:
    Uses a local, hardcoded sample manifest (some entries pinned+hashed,
    some not) baked into this module. No package installation, no model
    download, no network access of any kind.

Example request:
    GET /llm03/manifest

Expected result:
    A report listing each dependency/model artifact, whether it is pinned,
    whether its hash matches its recorded provenance hash, and an overall
    pass/fail per entry.

Defensive mitigation:
    Pin exact versions, record and verify SHA-256 hashes for model
    artifacts, use lock files, and fail the build when provenance can't be
    verified.

Logging/detection point:
    Every manifest check logs which entries failed validation, so CI can
    block a release on a failed check.

Test case: see tests/test_app.py::test_llm03_manifest
