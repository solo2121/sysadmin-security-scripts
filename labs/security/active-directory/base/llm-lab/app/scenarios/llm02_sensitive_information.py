LLM02: Sensitive Information Disclosure
=========================================
Vulnerability description:
    An assistant with access to internal fixtures (fake API keys, fake DB
    connection strings, a fake system prompt, fake PII) returns them
    unfiltered in a "debug" style response.

Educational objective:
    Show the difference between a response filter that redacts
    secret-shaped strings and one that doesn't.

Safe vulnerable behavior:
    All values come from data/fake_secrets/sample_secrets.json, which is
    entirely synthetic and clearly marked (FAKE-ONLY-, SYNTHETIC-,
    LAB_SECRET_ prefixes). No real secret ever enters this module.

Example request:
    GET /llm02/debug              (vulnerable — no redaction)
    GET /llm02/debug?redact=true  (defensive — redacted)

Expected result:
    Vulnerable mode returns the fixtures verbatim (still synthetic).
    Defensive mode returns the same payload with secret-shaped strings
    replaced by [REDACTED].

Defensive mitigation:
    Treat any response field on an allowlist of "sensitive field names" as
    redaction-required by default, and run a regex/DLP-style filter over
    free-text output before it leaves the service.

Logging/detection point:
    Every access to /llm02/debug is logged with whether redaction was
    applied, so unredacted access in production would stand out.

Test case: see tests/test_app.py::test_llm02_redaction
