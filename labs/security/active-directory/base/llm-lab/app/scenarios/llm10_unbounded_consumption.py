LLM10: Unbounded Consumption
===============================
Vulnerability description:
    Without input/output size limits, rate limiting, per-user quotas, and
    timeouts, an LLM-backed service is exposed to resource-exhaustion and
    cost-amplification attacks (a single request driving unbounded work).

Educational objective:
    Show every control in one place — max input size, max output size,
    rate limiting, per-user quota, and a simulated token/cost counter — and
    what a rejected request looks like for each.

Safe vulnerable behavior:
    Nothing in this module actually consumes excessive CPU, memory, disk,
    or bandwidth. "Processing" is simulated: the response reports how large
    the (bounded) output *would* be and a synthetic cost estimate, it never
    actually generates megabytes of text.

Example request:
    POST /llm10/generate {"prompt": "...", "requested_output_tokens": 999999}

Expected result:
    Oversized requested_output_tokens is clamped to the configured max and
    reported as such, never actually produced. Repeated calls beyond the
    rate limit / daily quota return HTTP 429.

Defensive mitigation:
    Enforce max input size, max output size, rate limits, per-user quotas,
    and timeouts before any expensive work starts, and log every rejection.

Logging/detection point:
    Every rejected request (413/429) is logged with the reason, which is
    exactly the signal a cost/DoS-monitoring dashboard would chart.

Test case: see tests/test_app.py::test_llm10_output_clamped and test_llm10_rate_limit
