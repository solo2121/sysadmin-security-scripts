"""
LLM05: Improper Output Handling
==================================
Vulnerability description:
    Model output is often passed downstream (rendered as HTML/Markdown,
    inserted into a query, deserialized as structured data) without the
    same scrutiny applied to any other untrusted input. That lets
    model-generated text carry an XSS payload, break a query, or violate a
    schema.

Educational objective:
    Show the same model output rendered unsafely vs. safely, for both
    HTML/Markdown rendering and a "structured data" schema check. No real
    exploit is executed against any host or service — this only shows what
    the unescaped string would look like if it were rendered.

Safe vulnerable behavior:
    Returns the raw, unescaped string in vulnerable mode (never renders it
    server-side); the caller only sees text, which cannot execute in this
    JSON API response. A simulated SQL fragment is shown as a *string*
    demonstrating what a naive f-string query would contain — it is never
    run against a real database.

Example request:
    POST /llm05/render {"model_output": "<script>alert(1)</script>"}

Expected result:
    Vulnerable mode echoes the raw string. Defensive mode returns the
    HTML-encoded version and a note about what changed.

Defensive mitigation:
    Always encode model output for its destination context (HTML-encode
    before rendering, parameterize before using in a query, validate
    against a schema before treating it as structured data).

Logging/detection point:
    Any output containing HTML/script-like markers is logged, so a
    downstream WAF/CSP violation can be correlated back to the originating
    request.

Test case: see tests/test_app.py::test_llm05_output_encoding
