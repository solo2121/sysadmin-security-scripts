LLM06: Excessive Agency
==========================
Vulnerability description:
    An assistant wired up to "tools" that can take real actions is
    dangerous if it can invoke any tool, with any arguments, without
    authorization or human confirmation. This scenario models that with a
    mock tool layer.

Educational objective:
    Compare an agent that will invoke any requested tool/action against one
    constrained by an allowlist, input validation, explicit authorization,
    audit logging, sandboxed paths, and dry-run mode.

Safe vulnerable behavior:
    The mock tool layer only ever calls app.safety.simulate_command (fixed
    allowlist, no real shell) and app.safety.resolve_sandbox_path (sandbox
    only). Even in "vulnerable" mode, the underlying primitives are safe —
    what's vulnerable is the *policy* (no allowlist/authorization check),
    not the execution primitive.

Example request:
    POST /llm06/agent-task {"tool": "run_command", "args": {"command": "rm -rf /"}}

Expected result:
    Vulnerable mode "accepts" any tool/action name and attempts to run it
    through the safe primitives above — a genuinely destructive command is
    still refused by the allowlist and reported, not executed.
    Defensive mode requires the tool to be on an allowlist, requires
    `authorized: true`, and supports `dry_run: true`.

Defensive mitigation:
    Allowlist tools and their argument shapes, require explicit
    authorization per call, log every invocation, restrict filesystem
    access to a sandbox, and support dry-run for anything destructive.

Logging/detection point:
    Every tool invocation attempt is logged with tool name, arguments, and
    whether it was authorized — unauthorized attempts are the alerting
    signal.

Test case: see tests/test_app.py::test_llm06_agent_task
