**Security Engineering Lab** is a modular, Vagrant-provisioned homelab for authorized security research and platform engineering. It includes isolated Active Directory environments, network segmentation, Kubernetes and DevSecOps workflows, Linux administration, and infrastructure automation.

The repository is designed to be **runnable, not static**: each lab includes deployable infrastructure, provisioning automation, validation workflows, and supporting technical documentation.

This project bridges offensive security, defensive validation, and infrastructure engineering by building reproducible environments where security controls can be deployed, attacked, observed, and validated.

**Maintained by:** Miguel A. Carlo (`solo2121`)  
**Project status:** Active development

## Which lab should I start with?

| Lab | Default VMs | Host RAM (min / recommended) | Free disk | Best for |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| [Active Directory — base](./labs/security/active-directory/base/) | 6; up to 11 with `LAB_PROFILE=full` | 16 GB / 32 GB+ | 200 GB+ | Learning core AD attack paths, including Kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting, and AD CS abuse, without network-segmentation complexity. Start here if you are new to AD security. |
| [Active Directory — segmented](./labs/security/active-directory/vlan-segmented/) | 7; up to 12 with `LAB_PROFILE=full` | 16 GB / 32 GB+ | 80 GB+ | Practicing lateral movement, routing controls, trust boundaries, and defensive visibility across segmented network boundaries. |
| [DevOps/DevSecOps](./labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/) | 2 (`minimal`); up to 12 with `LAB_PROFILE=full` | 16 GB for the minimal control plane / 32 GB+ for the full profile | 200 GB+ | Kubernetes, Harbor, CI/CD, GitOps, observability, runtime security, policy enforcement, and Linux administration. Not AD-focused. |
| DevSecOps Lite — ARM64 (planned) | — | — | — | Planned — not yet published. Intended as an ARM64-native Linux and Kubernetes platform-engineering environment for compatible ARM64 hosts. |
| [Windows Server Hardening (experimental)](./labs/security/windows-hardening/) | 1; 2 with `LAB_PROFILE=full` | 8 GB / 16 GB+ | 60 GB+ | A defensive counterpart to the AD base lab: a CIS-benchmark-inspired hardening baseline with controls mapped to specific attack techniques. Start after completing the AD base lab. |

> [!NOTE]
> Resource figures represent practical **host capacity**, not only aggregate guest allocations. Reserve additional CPU, RAM, and disk capacity for the host OS, Vagrant and provider overhead, base boxes, snapshots, package caches, and container-image storage.
>
> The segmented Active Directory lab's RAM figures reflect its default `ad` profile (7 VMs). Its `full` profile (12 VMs) needs more: 32 GB minimum / 48 GB+ recommended. See the [lab README](./labs/security/active-directory/vlan-segmented/) for the complete profile-by-profile breakdown.
>
> The DevOps/DevSecOps lab defaults to `LAB_PROFILE=minimal` (control plane + one worker) unless overridden. See the [lab README](./labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/) for the full `minimal`/`dev`/`full` profile breakdown.
>
> The ARM64 Lite profile is planning-only; see [Apple Silicon status](#apple-silicon-status).

Before deploying, run the full prerequisite check:

```bash
./scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --all
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use `./scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --all` before deploying Windows-based, multi-lab, or full-profile workflows.
>
> `make prereq` runs only the baseline prerequisite check and intentionally does not pass `--all`; it may not validate lab-specific dependencies such as Windows guest workflow plugins.

For the recommended progression from Active Directory fundamentals through segmentation and DevSecOps workflows, see the [Learning Path](./docs/project/learning-path.md).

For constrained systems, see [Minimal Resource Deployment](./docs/guides/optimization/minimal-resource-deployment.md).

---

## Quick start

> [!CAUTION]
> Some labs intentionally include insecure configurations and authorized security-test scenarios. Deploy them only on an isolated host and virtual network that cannot route to production, personal, or public networks. Review the [Security Scope](./docs/security-scope.md) and [Emergency Isolation Runbook](./docs/architecture/emergency-isolation-runbook.md) before deployment.

Clone the repository and validate your host:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solo2121/security-engineering-lab.git
cd security-engineering-lab
./scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --all
```

Start with the Active Directory base lab using the primary Linux provider:

```bash
cd labs/security/active-directory/base
vagrant up --provider=libvirt
```

Use VirtualBox only on a compatible Intel/AMD x86_64 host:

```bash
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
```

Check the VM state:

```bash
vagrant status
```

Supported lab environments include a Python-based `vagrant_manager.py` for interactive or scripted VM management:

```bash
python3 vagrant_manager.py
```

Examples:

```bash
python3 vagrant_manager.py up kali dc01
python3 vagrant_manager.py up --provider virtualbox
```

Verify available commands:

```bash
python3 vagrant_manager.py --help
python3 vagrant_manager.py up --help
```

After deployment, follow the selected lab README and health-validation guidance before beginning an exercise. A successful `vagrant up` does not necessarily mean that every guest service, domain role, or Kubernetes component is fully ready.

See the [Installation Guide](./docs/setup/installation.md), [Quickstart Examples](./docs/setup/quickstart-examples.md), and [Learning Path](./docs/project/learning-path.md) for provider setup, deployment patterns, and lab progression.

## Lab environments

| Lab | Purpose | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Active Directory Security Lab | Windows enterprise infrastructure, Active Directory security research, identity attack-path simulation, and detection concepts | [labs/security/active-directory/base/](./labs/security/active-directory/base/) |
| Segmented Active Directory Lab | Segmentation-aware Active Directory research, routing controls, trust boundaries, and lateral-movement constraints | [labs/security/active-directory/vlan-segmented/](./labs/security/active-directory/vlan-segmented/) |
| DevOps/DevSecOps Lab | Linux administration, Kubernetes, GitOps, observability, runtime security, and policy enforcement | [labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/](./labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/) |
| Windows Server Hardening Lab (experimental) | CIS-benchmark-inspired defensive hardening, with controls mapped to specific attack techniques from the AD base lab | [labs/security/windows-hardening/](./labs/security/windows-hardening/) |

### Active Directory Security Lab

The base Active Directory lab provides Windows enterprise-style infrastructure for authorized identity security research and defensive validation.

It covers Active Directory Domain Services, Kerberos, LDAP, Active Directory Certificate Services, credential-access simulation, privilege-escalation research, post-compromise workflows, and detection-engineering concepts.

See the [lab README](./labs/security/active-directory/base/) for provider-specific instructions, resource profiles, validation procedures, and authorized security-testing guidance.

### Segmented Active Directory Lab

The segmented Active Directory lab extends the base Active Directory environment with controlled routing, separated trust boundaries, and segmentation-aware security testing.

It supports research into lateral-movement constraints, network-security concepts, detection and response across boundaries, and controlled routing between lab segments.

See the [lab README](./labs/security/active-directory/vlan-segmented/) and [segmented lab troubleshooting guide](./labs/security/active-directory/vlan-segmented/docs/troubleshooting.md) for deployment and troubleshooting information.

### DevOps/DevSecOps platform lab

The DevOps/DevSecOps platform lab focuses on Linux platform engineering, Kubernetes operations, GitOps, observability, runtime security, policy enforcement, container-security testing, and integrated CI/CD validation.

See the [lab README](./labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/) for provider-specific deployment requirements, resource profiles, and validation guidance.

### Windows Server Hardening Lab (experimental)

A defensive counterpart to the Active Directory base lab: the same base box and AD-promotion pattern, but with a hardening baseline applied instead of intentional misconfigurations. Each control is documented against the specific attack technique it mitigates, using the base lab's own attack guide as the reference point.

This lab is experimental (`v0.1.0` MVP) and has not received the same level of real-world testing as the other labs. Complete the AD base lab first, then use this environment to study and validate the defensive side.

See the [lab README](./labs/security/windows-hardening/) and its [hardening guide](./labs/security/windows-hardening/docs/hardening-guide.md) for the full control list, known limitations, and baseline-validation procedures.

---

## Provider compatibility

Each full lab uses a provider-aware `Vagrantfile` supporting KVM/QEMU with libvirt and VirtualBox, subject to provider-specific requirements.

| Provider | Best for | Start command |
|---|---|---|
| **KVM/QEMU with libvirt** | Linux hosts with hardware virtualization and nested-virtualization support | `vagrant up --provider=libvirt` |
| **VirtualBox** | Compatible Intel/AMD x86_64 hosts running Linux, macOS, or Windows | `vagrant up --provider=virtualbox` |

KVM/QEMU with libvirt is the primary development provider and generally offers the strongest performance for CPU-, memory-, storage-, and network-intensive environments.

> [!NOTE]
> “Supported” means the provider workflow is maintained and validated for the documented lab scope. It does not guarantee identical behavior across every host kernel, provider release, Vagrant plugin version, third-party Vagrant box revision, or hardware configuration.

### Current platform compatibility

| Lab | Linux x86_64 with libvirt | Intel/AMD x86_64 with VirtualBox | Apple Silicon / ARM64 |
|---|---|---|---|
| DevOps/DevSecOps | Supported | Supported | Not supported |
| Active Directory base | Supported | Supported | Not supported |
| Segmented Active Directory | Supported | Supported | Not supported |
| Windows Server Hardening (experimental) | Supported | Supported | Not supported |
| DevSecOps Lite — ARM64 (planned) | Not applicable | Not applicable | Planned |

The **DevSecOps Lite — ARM64** profile is a roadmap item, not a published lab — see [Apple Silicon status](#apple-silicon-status) for details.

The segmented lab uses separate libvirt networks and isolated VirtualBox internal networks to model segmentation boundaries. VirtualBox networking provides logical isolation but does not reproduce physical IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging.

### Apple Silicon status

Apple Silicon Macs use the ARM64 architecture. Apple Silicon hosts are not currently supported or validated for the repository’s published lab workflows.

Although ARM64 Vagrant and virtualization workflows may be possible for selected Linux guests, this repository’s current lab portfolio depends on combinations of x86_64 Windows guests, x86_64 Vagrant boxes, guest media, provider-specific networking, nested-virtualization assumptions, and provisioning behavior that have not been validated on ARM64 hosts.

The following published labs are unavailable on Apple Silicon:

- Active Directory Security Lab
- Segmented Active Directory Lab
- Windows Server Hardening Lab
- The current full DevOps/DevSecOps lab
- Any workflow requiring x86_64-only Vagrant boxes, Windows guest media, or Intel/AMD-specific provider validation

A separate **DevSecOps Lite — ARM64** profile is planned for ARM64-native Linux and Kubernetes platform-engineering workflows. It is expected to focus on Kubernetes, GitOps, observability, runtime security, policy enforcement, and Linux administration.

Final component selection will depend on end-to-end ARM64 validation across the selected provider or runtime, guest operating system, container images, Helm charts, networking, provisioning automation, and test coverage.

Until that profile is implemented and documented, Apple Silicon has no supported deployment path in this repository.

See the [Installation Guide](./docs/setup/installation.md) for provider-specific setup instructions.

## Prerequisites

### Host requirements

- **Linux host:** Required for KVM/QEMU with libvirt full-lab workflows.
- **Linux, macOS, or Windows host:** Supported with VirtualBox on compatible Intel/AMD x86_64 hardware.
- **CPU architecture:** Existing Windows Server and most current Vagrant box workflows require Intel/AMD x86_64 compatibility.
- **Hardware virtualization:** Intel VT-x or AMD-V enabled in BIOS/UEFI where applicable.
- **Vagrant:** A currently supported Vagrant release compatible with the selected provider.
- **Virtualization provider:** KVM/QEMU with libvirt, or a supported VirtualBox release.
- **Python:** Python 3.12+ for contributor tooling and lab-management utilities.
- **Network:** Internet access for initial box, package, and container-image retrieval unless using prepared local or internal mirrors.

### Recommended resources

Resource requirements vary by lab, selected provider, deployment profile, box-cache state, snapshot usage, and container-image storage. Use the estimates in [Which lab should I start with?](#which-lab-should-i-start-with) as a planning baseline, then review the selected lab README before deployment.

For constrained systems, see [Minimal Resource Deployment](./docs/guides/optimization/minimal-resource-deployment.md).

### Vagrant plugins

Install only the plugins required by your selected provider and lab. Run the full prerequisite check first:

```bash
./scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --all
```

This validates host dependencies and enables lab-specific plugin checks. For the full list of provider- and lab-specific plugins (libvirt, VirtualBox, and Windows guest workflows), see the [Installation Guide](./docs/setup/installation.md).

## Architecture overview

[![Enterprise Infrastructure Architecture](./assets/diagrams/architecture-overview.png)](./assets/diagrams/)

The lab environments deploy independently through provider-aware Vagrant configurations. The architecture combines isolated Active Directory environments, segmented virtual networks, Kubernetes workloads, security monitoring, policy enforcement, and validation workflows.

The labs demonstrate:

- Isolated security research environments
- Enterprise-style Active Directory infrastructure
- Segmented network boundaries and controlled routing
- Kubernetes and containerized workloads
- Runtime-security monitoring
- Defensive hardening validation mapped to specific offensive techniques
- Reproducible infrastructure deployment
- Automated validation and documentation workflows

See the following documents for architecture details, trust boundaries, and design decisions:

## Common workflows

Run these commands from the selected lab directory.

> [!WARNING]
> `vagrant destroy -f` permanently removes the selected lab's VMs and can remove provider-managed disks. Vagrant snapshots are provider-dependent and are not a substitute for exporting artifacts or maintaining external backups of work you need to retain.

Everyday tasks — rebuilding a single VM, saving and restoring snapshots, re-running provisioning, destroying a lab, and switching providers — follow standard Vagrant commands (`vagrant destroy`, `vagrant up`, `vagrant snapshot save|restore`, `vagrant provision`). For the full walkthrough of each, including snapshot listing/deletion and performance-tuning options not covered here, see:

- [Quickstart Examples](./docs/setup/quickstart-examples.md)
- [Vagrant Management Tutorial](./docs/guides/infrastructure/vagrant-management-tutorial.md)
- [Guides](./docs/guides/)
- Lab-specific documentation and security-testing guides

---

## Troubleshooting

Most deployment issues fall into a few categories: `vagrant up` hanging or timing out, a VM created under the wrong provider, WinRM/SSH connection failures on Windows guests, and stale network or segmentation resources after an interrupted deployment. Start by re-running the prerequisite check:

```bash
./scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --all
```

For step-by-step fixes for each of these — including debug logging, provider-switch recovery, and network cleanup — see the [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/setup/troubleshooting.md) and the [segmented lab troubleshooting guide](./labs/security/active-directory/vlan-segmented/docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Security and ethics

This project is intended only for:

- Education
- Authorized security research
- Defensive security practice
- Isolated laboratory environments
- Testing systems owned by the operator or explicitly authorized for testing

Only test systems that you own or have explicit permission to assess.

Unauthorized access, testing, scanning, exploitation, credential attacks, or lateral movement against external systems is prohibited.

Intentionally vulnerable workloads and authorized security-test scenarios must remain isolated from production networks and systems.

For additional security information, see:

- [Security Scope](./docs/security-scope.md)
- [Threat Model](./docs/architecture/threat-model.md)
- [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)

---

## Known limitations

- Full-profile deployments require substantial CPU, RAM, and storage.
- Full deployments generally target 32 GB or more RAM and approximately 200 GB free disk space.
- KVM/QEMU with libvirt requires a compatible Linux host.
- VirtualBox support currently targets compatible Intel/AMD x86_64 hosts.
- Windows-based labs use Microsoft evaluation media; users are responsible for complying with applicable Microsoft licensing terms.
- The Windows Server Hardening lab is an experimental `v0.1.0` MVP with less real-world testing than the other labs. It does not yet cover AD CS hardening, LAPS, Credential Guard, or automated Sysmon deployment. See that lab's `docs/hardening-guide.md` for the complete list of known gaps.
- Third-party Vagrant boxes may change independently.
- CI validates repository quality and selected provider workflows but does not fully deploy every environment on every push.
- The project is designed primarily for a single-host laboratory architecture.
