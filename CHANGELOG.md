## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — pinned `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python` from the mutable `@v7` tag to the exact commit SHA that tag currently resolves to (`actions/checkout@3d3c42e...` = v7.0.1, `actions/setup-python@5fda3b9...` = v7.0.0), with a version comment on each line. Tags are mutable and can be force-moved; a pinned SHA can't change without a new commit. `dependabot.yml` already watches the `github-actions` ecosystem, so it will open PRs to bump the pin on new releases.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` / `Makefile` — the Python coverage step was informational only (`|| true`, couldn't fail the build). Changed to `--cov-fail-under=80`, an enforced minimum. Current coverage is 85%, so this has headroom for normal work while still catching a real regression.
- `tools/security/reconnaissance/amass-scan.sh` — added `set -Eeuo pipefail` to match the strict-mode convention used by every other script in `tools/`. This required initializing `DOMAIN=""` and `OUTPUT_DIR=""` up front, since both were previously read (`[ -z "$DOMAIN" ]`) before ever being assigned a default — harmless without `-u`, but would have aborted with "unbound variable" the moment strict mode was turned on.
- `tools/security/reconnaissance/amass-scan.sh` — fixed a pre-existing bug where every error path (`Domain argument is required`, `Unknown option`, `Too many arguments`) exited with status `0` instead of `1`. All three called `show_help()`, which unconditionally did `exit 0` internally, so the `exit 1` written right after each call was dead code. Moved the `exit 0` out of `show_help()` and into the one call site that legitimately wants it (`-h`/`--help`). Verified `--help` (0), no-args (1), `-s` with no value (1), too many args (1), and an unknown flag (1) all now return the correct exit code.

### Fixed
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` referenced `pylint` as the required Python linter in three places (Local Setup command, Code Standards, PR Checklist), but CI, the `Makefile`, and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` all actually enforce `flake8`. Updated the doc to match what's enforced.
- `requirements-dev.txt` was almost entirely unpinned and missing a trailing newline. Added `>=` version floors for every entry (`flake8`/`detect-secrets` pinned to match the exact versions already used in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; the rest floored at current stable releases), and added the missing trailing newline.
- Added a one-line reminder to inspect the script before piping to a shell above each `curl | bash` / `curl | sh` install command in `docs/guides/infrastructure/kubernetes-security-hardening.md`, `docs/guides/infrastructure/complete-devops-platform-guide.md`, `docs/guides/security/ad-mitre-log-source-playbook.md`, and `docs/guides/security/llm-security-compliance-lab.md`. Commands themselves are unchanged.

### Added
- `scripts/check_doc_references.py` (+ `tests/python/test_check_doc_references.py`) — scans doc-index bullets/tables (e.g. `` - **`docs/foo.md`** – ... ``) for backtick-quoted filenames that don't resolve to a real file on disk. `markdown-link-check` only validates real `[text](path)` Markdown links, so a plain-text filename reference like the stale `docs/network-map.md` in `labs/security/README.md` could go unnoticed indefinitely; this closes that gap. Wired into `make docs-refs`, a new blocking step in the `check-doc-links` CI job (it's local and deterministic, unlike the informational `markdown-link-check` step), and a new local pre-commit hook.
- `## Provisioning Philosophy` section in `docs/architecture/architecture.md` — states explicitly why each lab uses a single Vagrantfile with inline shell provisioners instead of Ansible roles (single-host lab, fewer dependencies to install, provisioning logic co-located with what it provisions), and links to the roadmap item that would revisit this if the labs grow enough to justify it.
- `scripts/README.md` — index for `check-prerequisites.sh` and `validate_lab.py`, matching the README convention already used by `assets/`, `docs/`, `labs/`, `tests/`, and `tools/`. Linked from the root `README.md` documentation hub table.
- `## Lab Documentation` section in each lab's `README.md` (`labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/`, `labs/security/ad-pentest/`, `labs/security/ad-pentest-vlan/`), linking to every file under that lab's own `docs/`. Previously `devops-linux-lab/docs/*.md` (6 files) and `ad-pentest/docs/attack-guide.md` + `docs/lab-credentials.md` were not linked from their lab README at all, and `ad-pentest-vlan/docs/*.md` only appeared inside an ASCII directory tree rather than as clickable links.
- `quickstart-examples.md` entry in `docs/setup/README.md` — the file was already linked from `docs/README.md` and `docs/architecture/architecture.md`, but missing from its own section's index.
- **CI:** Added caching for apt packages and Vagrant plugins to the `validate-vagrantfiles` job, significantly reducing its runtime.
- `tests/python/` — pytest unit tests for Python tooling logic (argument parsing, data structures).
- `tests/bash/` — bats unit tests for Bash script helper functions and configuration tables.
- `run-tests` CI job running pytest and bats on every push/PR.
- `check-doc-links` CI job that scans all markdown files for broken links and reports findings; informational only, does not fail the build (external link rot and rate limits are expected).
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — shellcheck, flake8, detect-secrets, and markdown-link-check hooks for local commit-time validation. Unlike the CI job, the local `markdown-link-check` hook blocks the commit so broken internal links are caught before they're pushed.
- `.secrets.baseline` — audited baseline of intentional lab credentials (AD pentest creds, Vagrantfile test passwords, LocalStack fake AWS key) so `detect-secrets` only flags genuinely new findings.

### Changed
- `assets/README.md` now documents the expected purpose of each asset category (diagrams, screenshots, icons, banners, logos) so contributors know where new asset types belong before adding a subfolder.

### Fixed
- `pyproject.toml` — `ruff`, `black`, and `mypy` were configured against `target-version = "py311"` / `python_version = "3.11"`, while `docs/dependencies.md` documents "Required: Python 3.12+" and CI installs Python 3.12 in every job. Bumped all three tool configs to target 3.12 to match what's actually required and installed, rather than leaving the linting/type-checking config silently out of sync with the documented minimum version.
- `.secrets.baseline` was stale: it still listed findings under old filenames (`docs/guides/infrastructure/Complete-DevOps-Platform-Guide.md`, `labs/security/ad-pentest/docs/ATTACK_GUIDE.md`, `labs/security/ad-pentest/docs/LAB_CREDENTIALS.md`, `labs/security/ad-pentest-vlan/docs/ATTACK_GUIDE.md`) from before those files were renamed to kebab-case, and had no entries for the current filenames or for `docs/guides/security/domain-compromise-walkthrough.md` / `labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/Vagrantfile`. This meant `detect-secrets` (in both the pre-commit hook and the CI `security` job) would treat the already-known, already-reviewed lab credentials in those files as brand-new findings the next time anyone touched them. Regenerated the baseline with `detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline`.
- Removed a stale `docs/archive/` exclude filter from `.secrets.baseline` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (`detect-secrets` hook); `docs/archive/` was deleted in a prior commit and the filter matched nothing.
- `SECURITY.md` referenced the old filename `LAB_CREDENTIALS.md`; updated to link the current `labs/security/ad-pentest/docs/lab-credentials.md`.
- Removed the "Reference archive" section from `docs/README.md` and the `docs/archive/` entry from the repository structure tree in the root `README.md`; both pointed at `docs/archive/`, which was deleted in a prior commit but never unlinked from the index.
- Fixed an undefined `counter` variable in `tools/sysadmin/utilities/timeshift-manager.sh` (`delete_snapshot`/`restore_snapshot`) that caused the script to abort under `set -u` when selecting a snapshot to delete or restore; now derived from `${#snapshot_array[@]}`.
- Broken relative links in `docs/architecture/architecture.md`, `docs/workflows/WORKFLOWS.md`, `docs/guides/infrastructure/proxmox-host-setup.md`, and `labs/security/ad-pentest/README.md` left over from the docs reorganization.
- Removed unresolved git merge-conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`/`=======`/`>>>>>>>`) that had been committed into `labs/security/ad-pentest/docs/attack-guide.md` and `docs/guides/security/domain-compromise-walkthrough.md`, along with the stale `exch01`/`sp01`/`pnpt-internal` content on the losing side of each conflict.
- Removed leftover editorial placeholder text from `labs/security/ad-pentest-vlan/docs/attack-guide.md`.
- Synced `labs/infrastructure/devops-linux-lab/README.md`, `docs/lab-guide.md`, `labs/security/ad-pentest/README.md` (+ `docs/attack-guide.md`, `docs/lab-credentials.md`), `labs/security/ad-pentest-vlan/README.md` (+ `docs/attack-guide.md`), `labs/security/README.md`, and the top-level `README.md` with the current state of all three Vagrantfiles.

### Planned
- Additional AD CS attack scenarios.
- Ansible role automation for the DevOps lab.

---

## [8.2.0] - 2026-07-31 — DevOps / DevSecOps Lab

### Added
- Integrated CI/CD server (`cicd-server`) running Gitea, Jenkins, SonarQube, HashiCorp Vault, and OWASP ZAP for a complete DevSecOps pipeline.
- Gitleaks and Trivy CLI tools on `cicd-server` for automated secret and container image scanning.
- Sample Jenkins pipeline (`DevSecOps-Pipeline.groovy`) and sample Flask app, wired to Gitea checkout, Gitleaks, Trivy, and a Harbor push.
- Port forwarding for Gitea (3000), Jenkins (8080), Jenkins agent (50000), SonarQube (9000), Vault (8200), and ZAP (8090).

### Known Issues
- `devops-1`'s Ingress NGINX forward (guest `80`) and Jenkins on `cicd-server` both default to host port `8080`. Running both VMs together (e.g. `LAB_PROFILE=full`) fails with a Vagrant port-collision error. Workaround: don't start both at once, or change `JENKINS_PORT` in the Vagrantfile before `vagrant up`.

---

## [1.12] - 2026-07-31 — AD Pentest Lab

### Fixed
- Moved plugin validation inside the `Vagrant.configure` block to prevent false-positive failures.
- Added error handling for a missing or unloadable `config.rb`.
- Fixed `vagrant-hostmanager` alias syntax (aliases are now a proper array of strings).
- `configure_windows_comm` now accepts `boot_timeout` and `winrm_timeout` parameters; DC01 keeps extended 7200s timeouts for AD promotion while other Windows VMs use the 3600s default.
- Added CPU/memory validation with warnings for out-of-range values.
- Fixed duplicate `/etc/hosts` entries on `kali` and `linux01`.
- Added SSH key management for `linux01`, `metasploitable2`, and `juice-shop`.
- Juice Shop's Docker container now runs with `--restart=always` and pulls the image explicitly before first run.
- Polkit CVE-2021-3560 provisioning on `linux01` no longer aborts if the service restart fails.

---

## [2.1.5] - 2026-07-31 — AD Pentest VLAN Lab

### Fixed
- Added named WinRM timeout constants; `DC01` keeps extended timeouts (10800s boot, 7200s communication) for AD promotion, while other Windows VMs use 7200s / 3600s defaults.
- `configure_windows_comm` now accepts optional `boot_timeout` / `winrm_timeout` parameters instead of hardcoding DC01-specific values inline.
- Plugin installation now fails loudly if `vagrant plugin install` does not succeed, instead of continuing silently.
- Resolved an undefined variable (`ca01_ip` → `vm_ip`) in the `CA01-ESC` DNS record that could cause DNS registration to silently no-op.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-14 — AD Pentest VLAN Lab

### Changed
- Vagrantfile header now documents OPNsense (`harmonnine/opnsense-kvm`) as
  the intended firewall/router for VLAN segmentation, replacing the
  earlier planned-but-never-implemented pfSense reference. VM definition,
  interface mapping, DHCP, and firewall provisioning are not yet
  implemented — lab topology and VM count (14) are unchanged from v2.1.3.

---

## [2.1.3] - 2026-07-08 — AD Pentest VLAN Lab

### Fixed
- Static IP configuration now uses 5-method adapter detection (target IP,
  lab subnet match, adapter name, non-NAT exclusion, and a debug fallback),
  plus disabled Duplicate Address Detection and set `SkipAsSource=false`.
- Windows Defender disabled via a registry-only approach (silent, reliable).
- AD promotion (`Install-ADDSForest`) now uses explicit named parameters.
- Domain DN and DNS A records hardcoded as literals to avoid Ruby
  interpolation edge cases.
- Silenced a harmless `Set-NetConnectionProfile` error on domain-joined VMs.
- Pinned exact box versions for `metasploitable2` and `juice-shop`.

---

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-07 — AD Pentest Lab (Enterprise Edition)

### Changed
- Centralized all VM constants (IPs, memory, etc.) in the Vagrantfile.
- Created a reusable domain-join function, removing 300+ lines of duplication.
- Added vagrant-hostmanager integration.
- Pinned all Ubuntu box versions.
- Added health checks and debug mode.
- Reduced LLM01 RAM to 4GB (was 8GB).
- Added external config support (`config.rb`).
- Improved error handling in all PowerShell scripts.
- Added provisioning checkpoints.

### Fixed
- Static IP configuration now uses 5-method adapter detection.
- Windows Defender disabled via registry-only approach.
- AD promotion now uses explicit parameters.
- Domain DN hardcoded for correct PowerShell interpolation.
- DNS records hardcoded with IP addresses.
- Silenced a harmless `Set-NetConnectionProfile` error.

---

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-03 — AD Pentest Lab (Enterprise Edition)

### Added
- Modern Active Directory attack vectors and expanded AD CS attack paths (ESC1–ESC9).
- Enhanced Linux, Windows, Cloud, and LLM/AI attack scenarios.

### Fixed
- CA01 vs `ca01-esc` inconsistency across the lab: only `ca01-esc` (172.28.128.25, CA name `LAB-ESC-CA`) is actually provisioned; docs, configs, and attack commands previously referenced a nonexistent `CA01` host at `.24`.
- Removed stale `/etc/hosts` entries in the Vagrantfile pointing to the phantom `CA01` host.
- Corrected resource budget calculation that double-counted a nonexistent VM (VM count 15 → 14, ~47.5GB → ~43.5GB).
- Removed unsupported `after` blocks in the Vagrantfile to restore `vagrant validate` functionality.
- Fixed the machine inventory table and network diagram in the lab README, the wrong IP in the attack guide's network map, and the ESC1/ESC8 example commands in the AD MITRE log-source playbook that referenced the wrong CA name and hostname.
- Applied additional stability, security, and provisioning fixes; improved documentation and overall lab reliability.

---

## [8.1.0] - 2026-07-03 — DevOps / DevSecOps Lab

### Added
- Automated DevSecOps attack scenarios and intentionally vulnerable deployments.
- Backdoored image build and Harbor push scenario.
- Terraform state file with intentionally leaked secrets for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security practice.
- Indirect prompt injection (RAG) scenario for AI/LLM security testing.

---

## [2.1.2] - 2026-06-20 — AD Pentest VLAN Lab

### Fixed
- Dynamic Linux interface detection, removing hardcoded `eth1`.
- Production-grade Windows static IP configuration, preventing provisioning hangs.
- Domain join hostname rename checks to prevent duplicate joins.
- Improved DC readiness detection with a ping check before domain join.
- Windows Defender disabled via a dedicated function.
- Domain name defined as a literal in PowerShell blocks to prevent Ruby interpolation issues.
- Correct RAM calculation banner now accounts for all VMs.
- Vagrant plugin check for `vagrant-reload` now shows a clear error message.
- Libvirt default prefix cleared to prevent VM name collisions.

---

- Kyverno now uses 3 retries with full namespace cleanup between attempts.
- Docker daemon is reconfigured after Harbor install to trust the registry before seeding.
- Worker provisioner no longer uses the invalid `--flannel-backend` flag.
- Terraform download now uses dynamic architecture detection instead of hardcoded `amd64`.
