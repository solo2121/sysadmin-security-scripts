# Security Policy

This document explains the security support scope for the security-engineering-lab and how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

---

## Supported Environments

This repository is actively maintained and tested on:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Debian 12

Other Debian-based systems may work, but they are not officially supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this repository, such as accidentally committed credentials, a script that could cause unintended harm, or a misconfiguration in the lab environments, please report it responsibly.

Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

### Preferred reporting methods

1. Send a detailed report to **security@solo2121.com**.
   Include your name, a description of the issue, and steps to reproduce it.
2. If email is unavailable, submit a confidential [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/solo2121/security-engineering-lab/security/advisories/new).

---

## Response Policy

- All reports will be acknowledged within **3 business days**.
- A fix or mitigation will be provided within **7 business days** when applicable.
- Reporters will be credited in release notes unless anonymity is requested.

---

## Intentional Vulnerabilities

This lab contains intentional vulnerabilities for educational and authorized research purposes. These are expected and by design.

Please do not report the following as security issues:

- Weak credentials in [`lab-credentials.md`](labs/security/active-directory/base/docs/lab-credentials.md).
- AD CS misconfigurations such as ESC1–ESC9.
- Intentional ACL abuse paths.
- LLM endpoints without authentication.
- LocalStack AWS services configured with permissive IAM.

## Repository-Level Controls (GitHub Settings)

The controls below live in this repository's *content* (CI workflows,
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.secrets.baseline`, `.github/dependabot.yml`)
and are verifiable by reading those files directly:

- Dependabot version updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`) for the
  `github-actions` and `pip` ecosystems.
- GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Local secret-leak prevention via `detect-secrets` in
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `.secrets.baseline`.

The controls below are **GitHub repository settings**, configured in the
GitHub web UI under *Settings → Code security* (or the equivalent API/
`gh` CLI calls) rather than in any file in this repository. Nothing in
this repository's content can confirm whether they're currently enabled —
verify them directly in the repository's settings if you're relying on
them:

- Branch protection rules or repository rulesets on `main`.
- Secret scanning and push protection.
- Dependabot alerts (as opposed to the version-update PRs configured in
  `dependabot.yml`, which is a separate setting).
- Code scanning (e.g., GitHub's default CodeQL setup).
- GitHub Actions permissions (e.g., whether Actions can approve pull
  requests, or the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission level for the
  repository as a whole, as distinct from the `permissions:` block
  already declared per-workflow in `ci.yml`).

## Security Best Practices for Users

- Run all lab environments in an isolated VM or network.
- Never expose Vagrant lab ports to public IP addresses.
- Keep your host OS updated and follow standard security hygiene.
- Treat all credentials in this repository as lab-only and never reuse them on real systems.
